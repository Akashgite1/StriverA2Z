Striver A2Z DSA Sheet Solutions üöÄ
üìå Introduction

This repository contains my solutions to the Striver A2Z DSA Sheet, a comprehensive roadmap for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms.
The problems are solved in C++ with an optimized approach wherever possible, and the repository is organized in the same order as the Striver A2Z playlist.

üèÜ Why Follow Striver A2Z Sheet?

    Comprehensive: Covers all essential DSA topics in a structured order.

    Interview-Oriented: Designed to prepare you for technical interviews.

    Competitive Programming Friendly: Improves problem-solving speed and accuracy.

    Progressive Learning: Starts from basics and gradually moves to advanced topics.

‚öôÔ∏è How to Use This Repository

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Akashgite1/StriverA2Z.git

    Open the desired .cpp file.

    In main(), call the required function or uncomment the existing test cases.

Compile & run:

    g++ filename.cpp -o output
    ./output

üõ† Use Case

    Each .cpp file contains multiple functions, and each function corresponds to a unique problem from the Striver A2Z Sheet.

    In the main() function, you can call the desired problem function with your custom test case.

    For some problems, test cases are already provided in the file.
    ‚Üí Just uncomment the test case code in main() and run the program.

    All approaches include time and space complexity analysis.

    Feel free to use, learn, and share these implementations.
